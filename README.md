The ATR Fib Indicator is a versatile tool designed to assist traders in analyzing price levels based on the Average True Range (ATR) of the day. Users can input their desired ATR value, and the indicator generates Fibonacci-based support and resistance levels dynamically on the chart. This helps identify potential price targets and zones of interest during intraday trading. Fully customizable with user-defined styles, colors, and Fibonacci ratios, it adapts to individual trading strategies and preferences.
